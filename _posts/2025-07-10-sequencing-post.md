## DNA Sequencing Post!

Today we learned about DNA sequencing and the different methods used. Initially, during the beginning stages of sequencing, the researchers at the Human Genome Project used a method called Sanger sequencing which involves using dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to randomly terminate DNA synthesis, creating fragments of varying lengths which are then separated by size using electrophoresis. By attaching fluorescent dyes to the ddNTPs, scientists can read the DNA sequence based on color signals, but this method was not only slow, but expensive, costing $10,000 per 1 Mbp. Over time, as more innovations have come about, sequencing has not only gotten fatser, but much cheaper (in 2011 it was only $0.10 per 1 Mbp, a significant drop from the $10,000 cost just 10 years before, and $0.01 per Mbp in 2021). 
Using Jupyter Notebook, we were able to analyze the data (the amount of base pairs in each chromosome) to calculate the cost to sequence the first two chromosomes. This exercise gave us a clear, visual way of seeing the massive reduction in sequencing costs, making more scientific exploration through sequencing possible.

| Year | Cost per 1 Mbp |
|------|----------------|
| 2001 | $10,000        |
| 2011 | $0.10          |
| 2021 | $0.01          |
