## The cancer that I am looking into!

Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow, where new blood cells are made, and affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. It is most common in young children, especially between the ages of 2 and 5, but it can also occur in adults. In the United States, about 6,100 new cases of ALL are diagnosed each year, making it a bit more rare compared to other cancers, but it is the most common type of cancer in children. Doctors usually identify ALL through a blood test called a complete blood count, which can show abnormal white blood cells. A bone marrow biopsy is then completed in order to confirm the diagnosis, and other tests like flow cytometry and genetic testing help determine the type and risk level of the leukemia. Some known risk factors for ALL include having certain genetic disorders like Down syndrome, being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals like benzene, and having a sibling with leukemia, although most cases happen without any clear cause. Unlike most solid tumors, ALL is not staged using the TNM system; instead, it is classified based on whether the cancer is untreated, in remission or has come back, and whether the leukemia cells are B-cell or T-cell type. Treatment usually happens in phases and can last over two years, and it usually includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and sometimes stem cell transplants or immunotherapy, especially if the cancer comes back. Children with ALL generally respond very well to treatment and have a high survival rate, with more than 90% surviving at least five years. However, adults tend to have a lower survival rate (around 30â€“40%), depending on age and specific genetic features of the cancer. Thanks to new treatments and better supportive care, survival rates continue to improve, especially in the case for most children.
