## Cancer cell lines Encyclopedia Notes
- what is a cancer cell line
  - a cancer cell line is a collected population from a patient's original tumor
  - can study just using hte cell line (in the lab) instead of needing the patient
- normal cells will die after a few rounds of dividing= senescence
  - cancer cells bypass the normal limits and can grow forever
    - these cells can grow in a petri dish or flask and become immortal
- first cell line= Johns Hopkins University
  - Dr. George Gey from a HeLa cell (cervical cancer tumor from Henrietta Lacks)
  - first cell to grow on a petri dish indefinitely
- on a HeLa cell the purple section is most likely the nucleus region
- the green portion is called the cytoskelton (type of protein that acts as a highway in the cell that works to transport materials)
- very easily distinguised (can count easily) 
  - this is helpful because you can see if the cell growth is inhibited, indicating the drug or treatment testing works
- why use cell lines?
  - its very easy to grow and manipulate in the lab
  - can grow from various types of cancers
  - serves as a model to: study the tumor genetics, discover cancer vunerabilities, and used to test theraputic compouds to see the efficacy
    - ex.) study signaling pathways in the cancer to see functional changes
- cancers have different subtypes, so when diagnosed with a certain type of cancer (in the body), you can know the specific type
  - ex.) in breast cancer: ER (estrogen), PR (progesteron), and HER 
  - what chemotherapy treatment that is delivered is based on the type of cancer subtype
- In 2000, Perout published a paper showing how around 65 tumors showcased different subtypes
  - this revolutionized the understanding of breast cancer heterogenity (people can see that you can;t treat all breast cancer the same)
- In 2009, anouther group refined from Perou's original 2000 genes to 50 genes for clinical use
  - they classified tumors into the same 5 subtypes (using qRT-PCR) and also introduced the Risk of Recurrance score
  - this led to the clonical test Prosigna (under Nanostrings Technologies Inc)
- the government puts a lot of money into storing cancer cell lines
  - have the Broad Institute which contains multi-omics data which is used to study cancer biology and predict drug sensitivity
- pharmacologic data is very useful for cell delivery
--------------------
In our example we used for Jupyter Notebook, we found out that in both breast cancer and in myeloid cancers that there a many different subtypes with soem occuring much mroe frequently than others. For example in breast cancer, the model subtype HER2+ occured 16 time (but the distribution was not only skewed towards that one type), while in myeloid cancer, the distibution was much more skewed towards the BCR-ABL1 positive subtype (though there were many different subtypes that occured, this one occured most frequently by far).
